# Installing the text mod

> [!WARNING]
> Due to Valve's restrictive changes to CS2, text mod no longer works as of April 2024.
1. Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/Alicesyn/CS-Text-Mod/releases) and click `csgo_alicesyn.txt` to download the latest mod
2. Go to this folder: `Steam\SteamApps\Common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\resource`
3. Create new folder: `subtitles`
4. Put the downloaded file in that folder and name it `closecaption_english.txt`

It should look like this: `game\csgo\resource\subtitles\closecaption_english.txt`
